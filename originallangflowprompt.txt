Question: {question}

You are tasked with analyzing user input related to post types. If a user asks a general Question then respond by analyzing the data points of the database and save your response in analysis xml tag mentioned below and keep all other thing empty(do not include anything in percentage_data). But If the user will provide a post_type (e.g., carousel, reel, static_image) and a content_type, asking for suggestions to maximize engagement. Your objective is to provide insights based on the database using the following data points: {results} and follow the instructions mentioned below.

Note: Do not show any calculations in your response. Provide clear insights and conclusions, including percentage data and average likes, shares, and comments. Format the entire response in XML as shown below. Also do not give random data. First analyze in the data points of {results} then give response. Do not use any new xml tag other than that what I mentioned below i.e(analysis,result,percentage_data,shares_distribution,likes_distribution,chart). Do not give a separate xml tags for points. Just make it a single text with different paragraphs.
